# Cryptocurrency

A simple Flutter clean architecture application that shows a list of cryptocurrencies and their
details. Cryptocurrencies are fetched from the CoinPaprikaAPI. The application uses BloC for state
management.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the project to your local machine.
2. Open the project using your favorite IDE/code editor (I recommend Android Studio).
3. Type ```flutter run``` in terminal to run program.
